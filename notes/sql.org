#+TITLE Notes for learning Emacs 
* CHapter 1 : Introduction Why you need SQL
** What is SQL
   It gives you a way to interact with data through means of creating or modifying
   tables.
** SQL and OOP 
   OOP dataset is organized around graph
   SQL is around tables
   Translation of data collection from OOP to SQL and back is doable
   SQL handle ternary relation easily using a fourth table
   OOP handle using a whole intermediate class 
* Exercise 0: Setup 

** Left 
   Really just to read documentation for SQLlite later if have question 

* Exercise 1: Creating tables 

** Declare Columns in a table 
   Formart is: 
              NAME TYPE which are separated by a space 
   Type can be INTEGER, TEXT or something else,
   each column is separate by commas.
   Perhaps need to determine a PRIMARY KEY ??

** How to create database
   To create database itself:
   sqlite3 ex1.db < ex1.sql

** Try to declare the same table twice
   It will give you warning, need to delete the old table and 
   create everything agina using the command above 

* Exercise 2: Creating a Multi-Table Database

**  "Relations"
   Tables that relate two or more other tables are called relations
   But some people call every table a relation, confusing , but worth noting
