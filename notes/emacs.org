#+TITLE: A brief notes for "Learning GNU Emacs"


* Chapter 1: Emacs Basics  

** Key to Emacs

   Integration of different tools you need to finish a task

** Understand Files and Buffers
   
   Each file is opened as a buffer, the original file is not saved until 
   you press c-x c-s 

** When opened a wrong file 
   
   c-x c-v to open alternative 

** Append a file at the cursor of another 
   
   c-x i

** Save as 
   
   c-x c-w 
   it can write a file that you have to permission into writing to 
   however, as expected, it creates another copy of it 

** How to search for command names 
   
   c-h f 

* Chapter 2 Editing 

** Refill mode 
   
   Keeps paragraph neat, M-x refill-mode Enter

** Go to specific line 
   
   M-x goto-line 

** Repeat command for n time 
   
   M- n 
   
   Or, just use C-u  
   if no number is added automatically uses 4, else execute 4 time

** Deleting lines 
   
   M-d delteing the remaining of the word
   c-d deltes a char 
   c-k kills an entire line 
   c-w kills a region which you will select earlier with c-space 

** Yanking 
   
   Everything you kill with commands other than c-d is assembled in 
   kill ring. 
   Calling c-y will yank those things back 

** Highlighting the part 
   with c-x c-x you see what you have just selected with c-space 
   
** Copy text 
   
   To copy a text, use m-w 

** Get deleted things back
   use M-y to get recently deleted texts back
