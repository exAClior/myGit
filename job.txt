See how deep learning fits into common image analysis and machine learning roles, ranging from machine learning engineer to data analyst to software engineer. Do job searches based on skills (such as natural language processing, bayesian statistics, and convolutional neural networks) and keywords (such as artificial intelligence, and ML frameworks), rather than job title. You will find more opportunities that are a fit for your skills and interests.
