* Motivation: How do you find a needle in a haystack?

** Naively

   #+BEGIN_SRC c++ 
     while(1){
       stick_your_hand_in_the_haystack();

       vehemently_move_your_hand();
       if(needle_stick_in_hand){
	 cout << "hurray I found the needle" << endl;
	 return 0;
       }

      }
   #+END_SRC
  
** A better way?
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC c++ 
     get_a_magent();
     use_the_magnet();
   #+END_SRC

** Magnet is Machine Learning
   - Is it really a black box?
   - But surely you don't know why it works.
   - Not a rigorous algorithm
   - There needs to be an invariant over some state that is related to our
     problem [[http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~pouchet/lectures/doc/888.11.algo.6.pdf][link to where I got this]]
   - Boring, but that's what's awesome about Machine Learning
     
** Large Amount of Data [fn:2]
   - It is costly to develop new algorithm
   - Over abundance of data
   - Hard and costly for humans to find the pattern
* Find a concrete example for the needle: Higgs
** Higgs Boson (naively) [fn:1]
   - Last elementary particle in the SM to be observed
   - Mechanicsm that gives mass to massive elementary particles predicts its
     existence.
   - But is it really necessary?
** Higgs Boson (closely) [fn:5]
   - Unification of the electromagnetic and weak force
   - Four force particles involved -> $W^{\pm}$, Z, and photon gauge bosons
   - Threee of the four annexes three Bosons and "breaks" this symmetry
   - What breaks it? Vacuum Expectation Value
**  VEV [fn:5]
   - Whether $\phi=0$
   - Field vs. Potential
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
     [[~/myGit/phy599/BoringPotential.png]]
     
**  VEV [fn:5]
   - Higgs is special!
   - Field is not zero when potential is lowest!
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Higgs-Potential-lookdown.png]]
	   
**  VEV [fn:5]
   - Breaks the rotation symmetry
   - Similarily for electroweak symmetry
   - One of the four Higgs obtains non-zero vev
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.7\textwidth :height=0.7\textheight  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Higgs-Potential-Goldstone.png]]
	   
**  Goldstone and Higgs Bosons [fn:6]
   - Excitation in different direction -> different Bosons
   - non-flat direction -> this boson has mass
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Higgs-Potential-radial.png]]

	   
**  But you still did not tell me why [fn:6]
   - The Higgs is needed for the probability to work out if you don't change
     anything about the theory
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/unitarization.png]]
     
   
** What if you change the theory? [fn:6]
   - The theory becomes non-perturbative
   - We need to introduce more internal virtual particles during a scattering
     process
   - Too many possible ways for the intermediate process to be, too complex
   - Meaning there are sub-particles that makes up W Bosons around TeV scale
   - Did not see that in experiments
   - Similar things could be explained with a much easier theory of Higgs, why
     not take that :)
* Time to carry out the experiment   
** What more do we know about the Higgs [fn:3]
   - Know the rough range of mass
   - General Consideration is for it to be smaller than ~ 1 TeV
   - Electroweak Measurement says it is  < 152 GeV
   - LEP Collider says it shoud be > 114.4 GeV
   - Final search region was between 110 GeV and 140 GeV at ATLAS
** Decay Channels
** What haystack?
   - what are the back ground noise?
   - What are the information that we can get?
** Challanges
   - Why is it difficults
* How does the experiment work?
  - describe how the experiment works and diverge to the machine learning part
    when we hit the obstacle of trying to find what we want to see
* How the magnet works?
  -mix the information about machine learning here.
** BDT
** Artificial Neural Networks
* Machine Learning Vocabs
** Decision Trees cite:geeksforgeeks_2019
   - Can be used to assign data to class
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/Decision_Tree.png]]
** Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) cite:Bourilkov2019
   - Convert weak to strong learner ?
** Artificial Neural Networks
   - Layers of nodes
   - Weighted inputs and nonlinear transformation
   - rectified linear unit (ReLU)
   - Hidden Layers : Deep Learning
** Optimizing the model
   - Evaluating a cost for model
   - Minimize the cost through evolution of model
   - Backpropogation (chain rules)
   - Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Machine Learning Examples:
  - Higgs Boson 2012
  - boosted decision tree
  - small signals (invariant mass peaks) over large smoothly falling
backgrounds
** Little bit of physics behind it
   -then the Higgs decays and couplings to the heavy W and Z
gauge bosons, as well as the heavy third generation quarks (bottom and top) and
tau leptons, have been observed by both ATLAS and CMS, and are consistent with
the predictions of the SM at the current level of precision
** What to look for
   - observing Higgs decays and measuring its couplings to fermions outside the third generation
   - decays to a pair of muons with oppotiste change ($\mu^{+}$,$\mu^{-}$)
   - But this only occurs with small probablility 0.02% ( other possibilities
     are Drell-Yan, top quark or W boson pairs production)
   - dimuon invariant mass peak near 125 GeV, only a few GeV wide, determined by
the experimental muon momentum resolution. In contrast, the background events
exhibit a smoothly falling mass spectrum in the search region from 110 to 160 GeV

* Quantum Computers to save the day? (The challanges and outlooks)
** Mentioned in paper 
  
  -The large amounts of data collected at colliders like the Large Electron-Positron
collider (LEP) or the LHC, and at the intensity frontier, mean that the statistical
errors on the collected data samples tend to get quite small, and often the systematic
effects become important and even limiting. Experience shows that a large, often
dominating amount of time in data analysis is spent on estimating and handling
the systematic errors, after the express production of first, exploratory, results.
  - scultping of variables , what does it mean?
* Backups
** Three Quaters of the Higgs Boson? [fn:4]
   - When we detected W and Z bosons, we have really detected the three quarters
     of Higgs Boson.
   - W and Z Bosons absorbed them to become massive
   - But force particles natrually appear in theory as massless
   - A solution is to annex a massive particle: Higgs Mechanism
   - Previously: Goldstone Bosons
   - "The difference between massless force particles (like the photon and
     gluon) and massive force particles (like the W and Z) is the longitudinal
     degree of freedom."
   - The Higgs breaks the electroweak symmetry for the weak charge that it had
   - The vacuum expectation values allows the three to be eaten
