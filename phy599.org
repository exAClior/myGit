* Motivation: How to find a needle in a haystack?

** Naively

   #+BEGIN_SRC c++ 
     while(1){
       stick_your_hand_in_the_haystack();

       vehemently_move_your_hand();
       if(needle_stick_in_hand){
	 cout << "hurray I found the needle!!" << endl;
	 return 0;
       }

      }
   #+END_SRC
  
** A better way?
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC c++ 
     get_a_magnet();
     use_the_magnet();
   #+END_SRC

** Are we not going to talk about ML
   - Is it really a black box?
   - But surely you don't know how it works
   - Not an algorithm in the traditional sense
   - There needs to be an invariant over some state that is related to our
     problem [fn:7]
   - Machine Learning don't need all that!
     
** Large Amount of Data [fn:2]
   - Hard and costly for humans to find the pattern
   - It is hard to develop new algorithms
   - Over abundance of data
   - LHC generates one billion events and three petabytes of data cite:Chen2015
     
* Find a concrete example for the needle: Higgs
** Higgs Boson (naively) [fn:1]
   - Last elementary particle in the SM to be observed
   - Mechanicsm that gives mass to massive elementary particles predicts its
     existence.
   - But is it really necessary?
** Higgs Boson (closely) [fn:5]
   - Unification of the electromagnetic and weak force
   - Four force particles involved -> $W^{\pm}$, Z, and photon gauge bosons
   - Threee of the four annexes three Bosons and "breaks" this symmetry
   - What breaks it? Vacuum Expectation Value
**  VEV [fn:5]
   - Whether $\phi=0$
   - Field vs. Potential
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
     [[~/myGit/phy599/BoringPotential.png]]
     
**  VEV [fn:5]
   - Higgs is special!
   - Field is not zero when potential is lowest!
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Higgs-Potential-lookdown.png]]
	   
**  VEV [fn:5]
   - Breaks the rotation symmetry
   - Similarily for electroweak symmetry
   - One of the four Higgs obtains non-zero vev
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.7\textwidth :height=0.7\textheight  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Higgs-Potential-Goldstone.png]]
	   
**  Goldstone and Higgs Bosons [fn:6]
   - Excitation in different direction -> different Bosons
   - non-flat direction -> this boson has mass
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Higgs-Potential-radial.png]]

	   
**  But you still did not tell me why [fn:6]
   - The Higgs is needed for the probability to work out if you don't change
     anything about the theory
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/unitarization.png]]
     
   
** What if you change the theory? [fn:6]
   - The theory becomes non-perturbative
   - We need to introduce more internal virtual particles during a scattering
     process
   - Too many possible ways for the intermediate process to be, too complex
   - Meaning there are sub-particles that makes up W Bosons around TeV scale
   - Did not see that in experiments
   - Similar things could be explained with a much easier theory of Higgs, why
     not take that :)
     
* Time to carry out the experiment   
** What more do we know about the Higgs [fn:3]
   - Know the rough range of mass
   - General Consideration is for it to be smaller than ~ 1 TeV
   - Electroweak Measurement says it is  < 152 GeV
   - LEP Collider says it shoud be > 114.4 GeV
   - Final search region was between 110 GeV and 140 GeV at ATLAS
** How do we produce the particles? [fn:3]
   - Collide two protons with center of mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 7 and 8 TeV$
   - Four decay channels
   - Event generators are used to give you expectation of what events you will
     see
   - But there might be in-time / out-of-time pile-up [fn:8]
   - Simulations calculated according to our assumed theoretical model (Monte Carlo)
   - What are measured
** Measurement devices [fn:8]
   - Tracking detector measures the position
   - Calorimeters measure the energy
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Device.png]]
** Needles and hay [fn:8]
   - Z boson plus jets make up most of the background
   - Decay of them gives high transverse momentum leptons
   - Decay of Higgs also gives high transverse momentum leptons!! Bummer!
   - Leptons from different source procedures are said to be from different jets
   - We have now turned a physics problem into a classification problem
* Machine Learning Comes in
** Decision Tree [fn:9]
   - Can be used to assign data to class
   - Weak Learners
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/Decision_Tree.png]]
** How to build it?
   - Supervised Learning
   - Provide set of data with labels
   - Start with no branches
   - Populate branches with varying leaf weights
   - Progress towards a good tree
** Determining how good a tree is
   - Training loss: mean squared error
   - $L(\theta) = \sum_i (y_i - \hat{y_i})$
   - Regularization term: how complex the model is
** In our context [fn:8]
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/EventSelection.png]]
   
** Boosted Decision Tree [fn:9]
   - Not the decision tree on steroids
   - Collection of Decision Trees
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Boosted_DT.png]]
	   
     
** How to improve [fn:9]
   - Add new trees into the collection that will make the result closer to the
     labeling
   - The new labeling should decrease the objective function
      
** In the LHC experiment [fn:3]
   - Different kinematic variables are used
   - Transverse Momentum of dimuon pair, muon pseudorapidity ......
   - Training set data, testing set data, and finally final measurement set data
     
** Not so raw data you are expected to see
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth  :height 0.7\textheight
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/CMS_momentum.png]]
** More invariant mass distribution
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth  :height 0.7\textheight

** Large Contribution

* Alternative towards BDT: Neural Networks
  
** Pros and Cons
   - BDT is not so black boxy
   - Structure of the Decision Trees Made it much harder to learn and optimize
   - Neural Networks has more "power" in terms of classification [fn:2]

** Artificial Neural Networks
   - Layers of nodes
   - Weighted inputs and nonlinear transformation
   - rectified linear unit (ReLU)
   - Hidden Layers : Deep Learning

** What it looks like
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/NeuralNetwork.png]]

** Optimizing the model
   - Evaluating a cost for model
   - Minimize the cost through evolution of model
   - Backpropogation (chain rules)
   - Stochastic Gradient Descent



* The challanges and letouts
** Left outs
   - Much more Machine Learning could do
   - Effectively increse luminosity
   - Ultrafast processing
   - Simulations through GAN
  
** Mentioned in paper 
  
  - The large amounts of data collected at colliders like the Large Electron-Positron
collider (LEP) or the LHC, and at the intensity frontier, mean that the statistical
errors on the collected data samples tend to get quite small, and often the systematic
effects become important and even limiting. Experience shows that a large, often
dominating amount of time in data analysis is spent on estimating and handling
the systematic errors, after the express production of first, exploratory,
results. [fn:3]
  - How to choose the structure of the neural networks
  - Parameter Tuning
    
* Backups
** Three Quaters of the Higgs Boson? [fn:4]
   - When we detected W and Z bosons, we have really detected the three quarters
     of Higgs Boson.
   - W and Z Bosons absorbed them to become massive
   - But force particles natrually appear in theory as massless
   - A solution is to annex a massive particle: Higgs Mechanism
   - Previously: Goldstone Bosons
   - "The difference between massless force particles (like the photon and
     gluon) and massive force particles (like the W and Z) is the longitudinal
     degree of freedom."
   - The Higgs breaks the electroweak symmetry for the weak charge that it had
   - The vacuum expectation values allows the three to be eaten
** What to look for [fn:3]
   - observing Higgs decays and measuring its couplings to fermions outside the third generation
   - decays to a pair of muons with oppotiste change ($\mu^{+}$,$\mu^{-}$)
   - But this only occurs with small probablility 0.02% ( other possibilities
     are Drell-Yan, top quark or W boson pairs production)
   - dimuon invariant mass peak near 125 GeV, only a few GeV wide, determined by
the experimental muon momentum resolution. In contrast, the background events
exhibit a smoothly falling mass spectrum in the search region from 110 to 160 GeV
