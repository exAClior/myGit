* Motivation: Needle in a haystack

** Naively

   #+BEGIN_SRC c++ 
     while(1){
       stick_your_hand_in_the_haystack();

       vehemently_move_your_hand();
       if(needle_stick_in_hand){
	 cout << "hurray I found the needle!!" << endl;
	 return 0;
       }

      }
   #+END_SRC
  
** A better way?
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC c++
     int main(){
       get_a_magnet();
       use_the_magnet();
       return 0;
     }
   #+END_SRC

** Black Magic
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     def main():
       accio_needle()
   #+END_SRC

** Are we not going to talk about ML
   
   - Is it really a black box?
   - But surely you don't know how it works!
   - Not an algorithm in the traditional sense
   - There needs to be an invariant over some state that is related to our
     problem cite:cormen_2009
   - Machine Learning don't need all that!
     
** Large Amount of Data cite:Bourilkov2019
   - Hard and costly for humans to find the pattern
   - It is hard to develop new algorithms
   - Over abundance of data
   - LHC generates one billion events and three petabytes of data cite:Chen2015
     
* Absolute minimium about the needle: Higgs!
  
** Higgs Boson (naively) cite:Aad2012
   - Last elementary particle in the SM to be observed
   - Mechanicsm that gives mass to massive elementary particles predicts its
     existence.
   - But is it really necessary?
     


	   
**  But you still did not tell me why cite:tanedo
   - The Higgs is needed for the probability to work out if you don't change
     anything about the theory
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/unitarization.png]]
     
   
** What if you change the theory? cite:tanedo
   - The theory becomes non-perturbative
   - We need to introduce more internal virtual particles during a scattering
     process
   - Too many possible ways for the intermediate process to be, too complex
   - Meaning there are sub-particles that makes up W Bosons around TeV scale
   - Did not see that in experiments
   - Similar things could be explained with a much easier theory of Higgs, why
     not take that :)
     
* Time to carry out the experiment   
** What more do we know about the Higgs cite:Chatrchyan2012
   - Know the rough range of mass
   - General Consideration is for it to be smaller than ~ 1 TeV
   - Electroweak Measurement says it is  < 152 GeV
   - LEP Collider says it shoud be > 114.4 GeV
   - Final search region was between 110 GeV and 140 GeV at ATLAS
** How do we produce the particles? cite:Chatrchyan2012
   - Collide two protons with center of mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 7$ and $8 TeV$
   - Four decay channels
   - Event generators are used to give you expectation of what events you will
     see
   - But there might be in-time / out-of-time pile-up cite:atlas
   - Simulations calculated according to our assumed theoretical model (Monte Carlo)
   - What are measured
** Measurement devices cite:atlas
   - Tracking detector measures the position
   - Calorimeters measure the energy
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Device.png]]
** Needle and hay cite:atlas
   - Z boson plus jets make up most of the background
   - Leptons from different source procedures are said to be from different jets
   - Decay of them gives high transverse momentum leptons
   - Decay of Higgs also gives high transverse momentum leptons!! Bummer!
   - We have now turned a physics problem into a classification problem
* Machine Learning Comes in
** Decision Tree cite:Chen:2016:XST:2939672.2939785
   - Can be used to assign data to class
   - Weak Learners
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/Decision_Tree.png]]
** How to build it?
   - Supervised Learning
   - Provide set of data with labels
   - Start with no branches
   - Populate branches with varying leaf weights
   - Progress towards a good tree
** Determining how good a tree is
   - Training loss: mean squared error
   - $L(\theta) = \sum_i (y_i - \hat{y_i})$
   - Regularization term: how complex the model is
** In our context cite:atlas
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/EventSelection.png]]
   
** Boosted Decision Tree cite:Chen:2016:XST:2939672.2939785
   - Not the decision tree on steroids
   - Collection of Decision Trees
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Boosted_DT.png]]
	   
     
** How to improve cite:Chen:2016:XST:2939672.2939785
   - Add new trees into the collection that will make the result closer to
     correct classification
   - The new labeling should decrease the objective function
      
** In the LHC experiment cite:Chatrchyan2012
   - Different kinematic variables are used
   - Transverse Momentum of dimuon pair, muon pseudorapidity ......
   - Training set data, testing set data, and finally final measurement set data

* Alternative towards BDT: Shallow Neural Networks
  
** Pros and Cons
   - BDT is not so black boxy
   - Structure of the Decision Trees Made it much harder to learn and optimize
   - Neural Networks has more "power" in terms of classification cite:Bourilkov2019

** Artificial Neural Networks
   - Layers of nodes
   - Weighted inputs and nonlinear transformation
   - Activation functions
   - rectified linear unit (ReLU) or sigmoid
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.4\textwidth :height 0.4\textheight  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/SNN.png]] cite:Lecun2015

** Optimizing the model
   - Evaluating a cost for model and let the model evolve
   - Backpropogation (chain rules)
   - Stochastic Gradient Descent
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.6\textwidth :height 0.6\textheight  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/SSNbp.png]] cite:Lecun2015
	   
* The Next Step: Deep Learning
  
** Deep Neural Network
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth  
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/NeuralNetwork.png]]
** Difference between Deep and Shallow NN cite:Guest2018
   - Effectiveness is the same
   - Many more hidden layers
   - Number of nodes might explode for the shallow NN
   - Different parameters were used in Shallow vs. Deep Neurual Networks
     cite:Sadowski2014
   - Shallow NN needs processing of "raw" data to get physically "meaningful"
     parameters as its input

** On a higher level cite:Guest2018
   - DNN is modular and hierarchical
   - Different modules are focus on different part of the data
   - Relies on the "raw" data to have hierarchial intrinsic properties
   
** Autoencoder cite:Goodfellow-et-al-2016
   - Copies imperfectly the input as the output 
   - Feed its output to another NN
   - Solves the vanishing gradient problem via unsupervised learning of layers
     of data
     
** Put words into pictures cite:Lecun2015
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth  
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/DNN.png]]
	 
** Physical examples cite:Guest2018
   - Typical events are made up of jets
   - Jets are made up of hardons
   - Hardons gives info on trackers and calorimeters
     
** On a more detailed level cite:Goodfellow-et-al-2016
   - Convolutional filter -> extracts the local features 
   - Pooling layer -> summarizes the local features by taking the max or average
     of the previous layer
     
* Example for the Higgs and related
** Higgs Identification cite:Apostolatos
   - Using $\eta$ and $\phi$
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth :height 0.8\textheight  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/etaandphi.png]]

** What neural network was used cite:Apostolatos
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth :height 0.8\textheight  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/DNNHiggs.png]]
** Jet Identification cite:Guest2018
   - Differentiate Jets from W, Z , H Bosons, quarks, and gluons
   - Traditionally done with flavor tagging and jet substructure tagging
   - Resembles human created algorithms that tells us which is which based on
     the property carefully picked by humans
   - We identified useful information, but did we throw away some hidden
     information when we group the jets this ways?
   - Feed the data into DNN, let it do the grouping for us.
** Raw parameters cite:Sadowski2014
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth  :height 0.4\textheight
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/rawparameters.png]]
** High level parameters cite:Sadowski2014
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.6\textwidth :height 0.6\textheight  
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/highlevel.png]]
** Results cite:Guest2018
   
   - factor of 4 improvement
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.7\textwidth :height 0.7\textheight  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/DNNimprove.png]]

** Things to take home
   - Relying on DNN is like asking a quesiton and getting an answer in a
     language that you don't understand. But the final result is written down in formulas.


* The challanges and leftouts
  
** Leftouts
   - Much more Machine Learning could do
   - Effectively increse luminosity
   - CNN auto detection of features
   - Simulations through GAN
  
** Challanges 
  
  - The large amounts of data collected at colliders like the Large
    Electron-Positron collider (LEP) or the LHC, and at the intensity frontier,
    mean that the statistical errors on the collected data samples tend to get
    quite small, and often the systematic effects become important and even
    limiting. Experience shows that a large, often dominating amount of time in
    data analysis is spent on estimating and handling the systematic errors,
    after the express production of first, exploratory, results. cite:Chatrchyan2012
  - How to choose the structure of the neural networks
  - Parameter Tuning
    
* Backups
  
** More examples
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth :height 0.8\textheight 
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/EventSele.png]]
** Higgs Boson (closely) cite:tanedo
   - Unification of the electromagnetic and weak force
   - Four force particles involved -> $W^{\pm}$, Z, and photon gauge bosons
   - Threee of the four annexes three Bosons and "breaks" this symmetry
   - What breaks it? Vacuum Expectation Value
**  VEV cite:tanedo
   - Whether $\phi=0$
   - Field vs. Potential
     #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
     [[~/myGit/phy599/BoringPotential.png]]
     
**  VEV cite:tanedo
   - Higgs is special!
   - Field is not zero when potential is lowest!
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Higgs-Potential-lookdown.png]]
	   
**  VEV cite:tanedo
   - Breaks the rotation symmetry (see by rotation)
   - Similarily for electroweak symmetry
   - One of the four Higgs obtains non-zero vev
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.7\textwidth :height=0.7\textheight  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Higgs-Potential-Goldstone.png]]
	   
** Goldstone and Higgs Bosons cite:tanedo
   - Excitation in different direction -> different Bosons
   - non-flat direction -> this boson has mass
           #+ATTR_LATEX: :width=0.9\textwidth  
	   [[~/myGit/phy599/Higgs-Potential-radial.png]]
	  
  
** Three Quaters of the Higgs Boson? cite:tanedo
   - When we detected W and Z bosons, we have really detected the three quarters
     of Higgs Boson.
   - W and Z Bosons absorbed them to become massive
   - But force particles natrually appear in theory as massless
   - A solution is to annex a massive particle: Higgs Mechanism
   - Previously: Goldstone Bosons
   - "The difference between massless force particles (like the photon and
     gluon) and massive force particles (like the W and Z) is the longitudinal
     degree of freedom."
   - The Higgs breaks the electroweak symmetry for the weak charge that it had
   - The vacuum expectation values allows the three to be eaten

** Not so raw data you are expected to see cite:atlas
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth  :height 0.7\textheight
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/CMS_momentum.png]]
** More invariant mass distribution cite:atlas
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth  :height 0.7\textheight
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/ATLAS_small.png]]
** Large Contribution cite:atlas
         #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth  :height 0.7\textheight
	 [[~/myGit/phy599/ATLAS_large.png]]
** What to look for cite:Chatrchyan2012
   - observing Higgs decays and measuring its couplings to fermions outside the third generation
   - decays to a pair of muons with oppotiste change ($\mu^{+}$,$\mu^{-}$)
   - But this only occurs with small probablility 0.02% ( other possibilities
     are Drell-Yan, top quark or W boson pairs production)
   - dimuon invariant mass peak near 125 GeV, only a few GeV wide, determined by
the experimental muon momentum resolution. In contrast, the background events
exhibit a smoothly falling mass spectrum in the search region from 110 to 160 GeV
** Flavor tagging: cite:Guest2018
   Heavy quarks decay weakly in a matter of picoseconds, which is sufficient
   time for a highly boosted quark to travel roughly a centimeter from the
   interaction point. Due to this measurable separation, flavor tagging relies
   heavily on tracks reconstructed by high-granularity sensors near the interaction
   point, and on vertices fit to these tracks.
