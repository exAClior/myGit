** Lists and Membership Operators
*** If you use index -1 you get the last item, -2 second to last
*** let q3 be a list q3[3:6] slices 
*** python list can contain a mix of different data types
*** use key word "in" "not in" to determine whether a data is in a list or not
*** List is a mutable data strucvture  type but string is not
*** the other important quality is whether a data structure type is ordered or not
*** ordered or not depends on whether we can use the position of the element in a data structure to access them
** List Methods
*** Lists are likely to be pass by reference since one list which are pointed by two different variable names are mutated at the same time when one varies
*** for string, max operator compares the alphabetical order
*** sorted() sorts the data structure
*** string.join(..) joins string elements together connecting them with the string on which join is called upon
** Tuples
***  Like list but are immutable and ordered
** Sets
***  Unordered and unique elements, can create set from lists using set(list_name)
*** pop()
** Dictionary
*** store key and value pair
*** use "in" or ".get()" to check if a key is in the dict

** Integer and Floats
*** Use type(x) to look up the type of a variable
*** use int(x) to cast x into a data type
*** 
** String
*** String in python is immutable
*** + to combine string
*** * to multiply string
*** format() can be used to print designated outputs

** Arithemetic operator 
*** to take power, use "**"
*** ^ does bitwise xor
*** "//" integer division, rounds the answer down
