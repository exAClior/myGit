# +TITLE: This is the note for online course on Edx about Intro to Linux 

* To redirect stderr's output into another file:   
** do_something 2> error-file 
** 2 because it is the file descriptor of stderr
* To put the output of stderr and stdout into the same file
** do_something > all-output-file 2>&1
** do_something >& all-output-file 
* For pipes, the latter commands don't have to wait for the previous ones to finish in order to start
** This implies although the latter commands use output of previous as input, they must have some other input they can use and start computing 
** Plus: this saves I/O of output on disk, which is very slow
** Form : command1 | command2 | command3
* While searching for files
** ls ba?.cpp : gives all files whose third character can be anything
** ls ba*.cpp : gives all files whose third to nth character can be anything
** Similarily replace */? with [set of char] or [ÔºÅ set of char] 
*** A set of char can be in the form of [a-n]
* To use find 's result and execute other commands
** find -name "?????" -exec rm {} ';'
*** {} is there in place of the location of file provided by output of find
*** can also replace -exec with -ok
*** ';' is equal to "\;" which end the command 
*** You can also seach files by parameters like -ctime -size , see for detail in manual
* Useful link for Basic Packagaing Commands

* Useful commands for finding documentation
** man command
** command --h 
** info (No search is available here)
** yelp man:cat
*** search for man about cat in a graphical help system
* Can use the following commands to look up document
** man command
** info 
** command --h
** yelp man:command
* Zombie State
** Sometimes a child process finished but the parent process does not ask for its state. The child process is then a zombie process
** Scheduling in a quantum computer might be tricky, b/c allocating the ions for computation means to store previous results on disk, this is going to be really expensive comparetively. 
* Processes that runs in background has a lower priority 
* The command "jobs" shows all jobs that runs in background
* make sure you provide -9 flag for command: kill
* command: top is the real time version of ps
** pressing certain keys under top, can renice or kill a process
* Use command : at to schedule tasks to be done in the future
* cron can do just the same but can repeat the command periodically 
* Sleep puts command to sleep
